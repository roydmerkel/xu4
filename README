XU4 is a recreation of the classic computer game Ultima IV. The
purpose of the project is to make it easy and convenient to play on
modern operating systems.  xu4 is primarily inspired by the much more
ambitious project Exult.  Linux is the primary development platform,
but it should be trivial to port to any system with SDL support.

XU4 isn't a new game based on the Ultima IV story -- it is a faithful
recreation of the old game, right up to the crappy graphics.  If you
are looking for a game with modern gameplay and graphics, this is not
it -- sorry.

STATUS
------

New in v0.03:
 - support for the VGA upgrade patch
 - "Wear Armour", "Ready Weapon", "New Order", "Locate Position" commands work
 - more progress on spells
 - water, lava, energy fields are all animated
 - an animated cursor is shown
 - the moons cycle through their phases
 - Lord British talks!  Doesn't heal yet, though

New in v0.02:
 - dynamic scaling ("./u4 -scale 1" runs at original resolution,
   "./u4 -scale 2" and twice normal size, etc)
 - ztats now display character stats and inventory
 - the Ultima 4 data files can now be located in the current
   directory, a subdirectory called "ultima4", /usr/lib/u4/ultima4 or
   /usr/local/lib/u4/ultima4
 - the Ultima 4 data files can be uppercase or lowercase
 - some work on spells has begun

v0.01 features:
 - stunning EGA graphics
 - walking around the world, entering cities and castles
 - the ladders between the two floors in the castle of Lord British
 - conversations with citizens (not merchants, Lord British, or
   Hawkwind)
 - saving the game remembers your position
 - unlocking and opening of doors

To do, in no particular order:
 - sound, music
 - moongates
 - dungeons
 - line of sight (shouldn't be able to see through walls)
 - karma
 - monsters, combat
 - horses, ships, balloons
 - Hawkwind
 - spells
 - autoconf, automake
 - gem viewing
 - everything else :)

Some thoughts for possible improvements:
 - Ultima 5 style aiming in combat (i.e. allow angle shots)
 - support for higher-resolution tile sets


COMPILING
---------

Note that you need SDL and the SDL development libraries & headers to
compile.  Assuming they are present, type make in the src directory to
build it.  An executable called u4 is created.

RUNNING
-------

The actual data files from Ultima 4 are loaded at runtime, which means
that a copy of Ultima 4 for DOS must be present at runtime.
Fortunately, Ultima IV is available as closed-source freeware on the
internet (legally). It is available at
http://www.zip.com.au/~mfleming/ultima/u4download.html, among many
other sites.

Once downloaded, it must be unzipped in one of four places:
 - the current directory when u4 is run
 - a subdirectory named "ultima4" of the current directory
 - "/usr/lib/u4/ultima4/"
 - "/usr/local/lib/u4/ultima4/"

As of version 0.02, xu4 can handle uppercase or lowercase filenames.
