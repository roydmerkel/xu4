XU4 is a recreation of the classic computer game Ultima IV. The
purpose of the project is to make it easy and convenient to play on
modern operating systems.  xu4 is primarily inspired by the much more
ambitious project Exult.  Linux is the primary development platform,
but it should be trivial to port to any system with SDL support.

XU4 isn't a new game based on the Ultima IV story -- it is a faithful
recreation of the old game, right up to the crappy graphics.  If you
are looking for a game with modern gameplay and graphics, this is not
it -- sorry.

STATUS
------

What works in v0.01:
 - stunning EGA graphics
 - walking around the world, entering cities and castles
 - the ladders between the two floors in the castle of Lord British
 - conversations with citizens (not merchants, Lord British, or
   Hawkwind)
 - saving the game remembers your position

To do, in no particular order:
 - support the VGA upgrade patch
 - sound, music
 - moongates
 - dungeons
 - line of sight (shouldn't be able to see through walls)
 - player stats, inventory, items
 - karma
 - monsters, combat
 - horses, ships, balloons
 - Lord British, Hawkwind
 - spells
 - windows port
 - autoconf, automake
 - everything else :)

COMPILING
---------

Note that you need SDL and the SDL development libraries & headers to
compile.  Assuming they are present, type make in the src directory to
build it.  An executable called u4 is created.

RUNNING
-------

The actual data files from Ultima 4 are loaded at runtime, which means
that a copy of Ultima 4 for DOS must be present at runtime.
Fortunately, Ultima IV is available as closed-source freeware on the
internet (legally). It is available at
http://www.zip.com.au/~mfleming/ultima/u4download.html, among many
other sites.

Create a subdirectory called ultima4 under u4/src (or whereever you
will be running it from), and unzip ultima 4 there.  You may need to
use "unzip -L" to get the filenames right.
