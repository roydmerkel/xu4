- Been working on timing of animations and events.
	- Need to fix movement, compare movement with battle movement, update creature movement when the screen should update

FIX BATTLE MOVEMENT for monsters.  add delay.

Take sum of all overworld/town creatures delay, and use that as a portion
of the regular step delay for even stepping.
Integrate background animation into the mix.
