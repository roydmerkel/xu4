To make xu4 modular, it must be possible to add new tiles,
and have visual representations of tiles be decoupled from tile rules.

- Explicitly map ULTIMA4 tileset indices to tile types
  Remove requirement that tilemap-base.xml needs to specify 'frames'
  in order to have tiles obtain the correct index.

- Remove visualization details from tile properties

- tileset-base.xml
	- Remove attributes:
		- 'animation'
		- 'frames'
		- 'usesReplacementTileAsBackground'
		- 'usesWaterReplacementTileAsBackground'
	
	- Change attributes:
		Flags
		- 'sailable'
		- 'swimmable'
		- 'walkable'
		
		- 'rule' (work with tilerules.xml!)
			- water
			- shallows
			- swamp
			- grass
			- brush (assuming that forest is has same slow progress as brushland)
			- hills
			- mountains
			- settlement
			- civilization
			- entrance #ie: LBC entrance
			- bridge
			- solid
			- wall
		
		- 'opaque'
			- true
			- false (default)
