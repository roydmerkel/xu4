How to Compile xu4 from CVS in MacOSX
=====================================

These instructions let you build xu4 from CVS without having to install
FINK to get the various libraries. You will not be able to build some
of the utils, as they are dependant on libpng, for which there is currently
no MacOSX framework binary. You will be able to build xu4 itself however.

-------------------------------
Things you only have to do once
-------------------------------

1. Download and install the MacOSX developer tools from:
   http://developer.apple.com/
   (Be sure to the get the Dec2002gccUpdater as well.)

2. Download and install SDL-devel-1.2.5.pkg.tar.gz from:
   http://www.libsdl.org
   (This should install into your HOME directory's Library/Frameworks folder)

3. Download and install SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.5.pkg.tar.gz from:
   http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
   (This should install into your HOME directory's Library/Frameworks folder)

4. Download gnome-combo.dmg.gz from:
   http://www.zveno.com/open_source/libxml2xslt.html
   Open it, and drag-copy libxml.framework and libiconv.framework into
   your home directory's Library/Frameworks folder

5. Start the Terminal app (usually in /Applications/Utilities)

6. Change to the directory where you want XU4 cvs
   e.g. cd ~/

7. Check out the current xu4 cvs source code
   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xu4 login
   Just press enter when it asks for password
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xu4 co u4

8. Change to the src directory of the XU4 source code
   i.e. cd u4/src

9. Now you need to create a necessary build file. Run this command:
   gcc -I$HOME/Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Headers -c -o SDLMain.o /Developer/ProjectBuilder\ Extras/Project\ Templates/Application/SDL\ Application/SDLMain.m

10. Compile xu4
    make -f Makefile.macosx u4

------------------------------------------------------------
Things you have to do every time the xu4 source code changes
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Start the Terminal app

2. Change to the xu4 directory
   e.g. cd u4

3. Checkout the latest changes from CVS
   cvs update -d

4. Change to the source directory
   cd src

5. Compile xu4
   make -f Makefile.macosx clean
   make -f Makefile.macosx u4
