Ultima 4 File Structures
========================

SHAPES.EGA
----------

This contains the bitmaps for each tile.  Each tile is 16x16 pixels,
and each byte represents two pixels.  In other words, the first 8
bytes represent the 16 pixels on the first row of the first tile.

offset  len  notes
0x0     128  tile 0
0x80    128  tile 1
0x100   128  tile 2
...
0x7F80  128  tile 255


CHARSET.EGA
-----------

This contains the bitmaps for each character in the font.  Each
character is 8x8 pixels, and each byte represents two pixels.  In
other words, the first 4 bytes represent the 8 pixels on the first row
of the first character.  The order is the standard ASCII mapping; 'A'
is character 65, 'z' is character 122.

offset  len  notes
0x0     32   character 0
0x20    32   character 1
0x40    32   character 2
...
0x1FC0  32   character 255


WORLD.MAP
---------

This is the map of Britannia. It is 256x256 tiles in total, broken up
into 64 32x32 chunks.  The first chunk is in the top left corner, the
next just below, and so on, until the last in the bottom right corner.
Each tile is stored as a byte that maps to the tiles in SHAPES.EGA.

The "chunked" layout is an artifact of the limited memory on the
original machines that ran Ultima 4.  The whole map would take 64k,
too much for a C64 or an Apple II, so the game would keep a limited
number of 1k chunks in memory at a time.  As the player moved around,
old chunks were thrown out as new ones were swapped in.

.ULT files
----------

These contain town information.  Specifically, a 32x32 map, plus the
starting position, movement behavior, and conversation index of each
NPC.  The conversation index gives the starting position of the NPC's
dialog block in the cooresponding .TLK file.  I'm not sure why some of
the data is duplicated.

.TLK files
----------

These contain conversation information.  The file has a 288 (0x120)
byte block containing his or her dialogues, plus the words that
trigger his or her responses (keywords).  Most of the fields are
variable length strings terminated by a single zero byte and the
following field starts immediately after.  The blocks are padded
with zero bytes to 288 bytes.

.CON files
----------

These files contain the 11x11 battleground maps shown when combat
starts.  It has the map itself plus starting positions for up to 16
monsters and 8 party members.

.DNG files
----------

These files contain dungeon information.  The first 512 bytes are the
8x8 maps for each of the 8 levels.  These are used for the dungeons 3D
mode.  The rest of the file is a set of 16 (64 in the case of the
ABYSS.DNG) 256 byte blocks that define the dungeon rooms.
